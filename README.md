# Community-Connections

This project allows a user to modify a "community" of people objects and interact with them. 

This is mostly an exercise I created to push my JavaScript skills to create a modern feeling application. 

It is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no dependencies on other frameworks or technologies.
